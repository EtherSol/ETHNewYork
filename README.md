<h3> **There was a discover when creating this project that ERC-20 token votes are based off of wallets that has the most volume.
     This can be a problem because you can have multiple wallets, and bot wallet addresses to affect the voting systems when altering
     the protocol. A suggestion and way to improve in this matter is to have a Proof of Humanities when tackling on this problem within 
     cryptocurrency voting. </h5>
